      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm Anand Ganta, a final-year Computer Science student passionate about data science,
        full-stack development, and solving real-world problems using technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked on projects involving machine learning, web development (MERN stack),
        and backend database design. I'm a curious learner and love to experiment with new ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy organizing events, mentoring peers, and exploring entrepreneurship.
